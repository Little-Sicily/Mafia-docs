Don't know what project to start? Feel free to steal some ideas from us:

## Online:
Reddit is a great place to start
- [r/startupideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/startupideas/)
- [r/Startup_Ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/)
- [r/SomebodyMakeThis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/)

These websites are great to find, validate or shape your ideas:

- [oasis-of-ideas.com](https://oasis-of-ideas.com)

Cool MIT research about the ideas (raw and unstructured, still interesting):
- [Ideonomy research](https://ideonomy.mit.edu)

Lastly, it's always super cool to steal shit from Buildspace, so go ahead:
